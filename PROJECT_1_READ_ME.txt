crack.cpp successfully cracks the keys used in all the log files provided in the webpage.

Project 1 folder contains
1) crack.cpp
2) Makefile

Compiling the Code:
1) Run "make" in the folder containing the Makefile and crack.cpp.
2) Execuatable file "crack" is generated in the folder. 

Currently in the folder, log files provided in the webpage are not attached as the size is too huge.
Files should be downloaded and placed in the folder to check the cracking of the files.

Running the program for cracking the key:
Command: ./crack log1.wep to crack the key for the first log.

Similarly other logs can also be cracked using the same command with arguments as log file names.
